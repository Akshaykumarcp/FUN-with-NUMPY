""" Basic operations on numpy arrays (addition, etc.) are elementwise

This works on arrays of the same size. Nevertheless, Itâ€™s also possible to do operations on arrays of different sizes if NumPy can transform these arrays so that they all have the same size: this conversion is called broadcasting. """
