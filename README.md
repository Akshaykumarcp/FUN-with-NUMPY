### 1. What is numpy ?
- The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- Can create multidimensional arrays and perform numerical operations at high speed
- Numpy has many built in functions for linear algebra, statistical analysis, transformations etc
- Libraries such as keras, pandas, matplotlib depend on numpy lib
- Official github repo of numpy can be found [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

  ```
  Numpy 

  Num --> Numeric
  py --> python

  Numpy = numerical python
  ```

### 2. Numpy provides
- Good efficiency because closer to hardware
- multi-dimention arrays
- scientific computation
- memory & time efficient
